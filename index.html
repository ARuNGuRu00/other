            <h2>1.What is the problem?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="cap"></span>We had a Bluetooth speaker due to some miss handling its <abbr title="Right Green Blue">RGB</abbr> light 
                button was broken. We recured the button While accessing the speakers <abbr title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</abbr>, 
                which brocked connecting points and mounting points. A layer of the PCB at the mounting endpoints were completly 
                cameout with the button, these end surfaces are more important because when we apply focus to the button 
                these mounting surfaces will transfers the pressure to the PCB so that the button can be stable for next press.
            </p>

            <h2>2.What we did?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="cap"></span>After analysing the PCB, we are sure that the connecting ends of the button can be soldered as it is, but the mounting end 
                are more challenging because I desided to solder the mounting end with the near by buttons mounting ends but they had a bit of gap,
                so it may are mayn't be soldered properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cap"></span>We prepared to solder after a while, first we soldered the connecting ends properly with out any miss lead, Then we tried to 
                solder a the moulding ends with near by ends as a predicted where a bit of gap and the soldering tip also made the process hard.
                So I melted a bit more soldering wire and applyed between the button like in a building construction :) which made the mounting ends
                to make a connect for support, it worked!!!.
